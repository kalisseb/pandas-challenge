## Python Libraries used:
pandas and pathlib

Csv's of School and student data were uploaded, cleaned nd merged. 

## District Summary

Using the combined school/student data we were able to determine the number of students within the district, overall budget, average scores for reading and math, and a percentage of students who are passing reading, math, and school overall. 

## School Summary

A summary of the same data in the Disrict Summary was gathered and grouped by school name with the school type also indicated. The data indicates that while budgets per students are comparable, the number of students in charter schools is much lower and their academc performance much higher. 

The top 5 highest performing schools by reading, math, and overall scores are all charter schools with 90.54%+ overall students passing. The lowest performing schools are all public/district schools and have an overall passing rate of 53.54% and lower. Budgets per student are similar but total student counts are nearly double in public/district schools than in charters.

## Math Scores by Grade

When math scores, grouped by school, are compared from one grade to another, there is typically little to no change year over year. Indicating that students performance remains constant from one grade to the next in conjunction with new curriculum. this also suggests student performance in earlier grades can be used to indicate performance in later grades.

## Reading Scores by Grade

Much like with the math scores, reading scores saw little to no change from one grade to the next. The same assumptions regarding student performance could be made for Reading and Math.

## Scores by Spending

As seen in the school summary, the spending ranges per student are all within $100 dollars from one school to the next. The data indicates that budget/spending per student has little to do with performance in either Reading, Math, or overall. However the total students within each school and type is significantly. In the future, a linear regression model of this data comparing student scores, total students, and spending would be suggested.
